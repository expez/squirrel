# squirrel

Often, when writing tests, I find myself calling some production services or accessing a db to get some authentic data for use in my tests.  Then I create mocks which returns the previously collected data.

Squirrel helps you with

1. Squirrelling away values, by instrumenting functions and persisting the input => output pairs.
2. Easily creating mocks with previously recorded canned responses.

## Usage

We want to test foo, but at the very bottom foo relies on bar and baz which call some external services.  In the repl we do:
```clj
(recording [bar baz] some-file
  (foo user-id))
```

This will record the observed input => output pairs for the functions `bar` and `baz` into `some-file` which we can use in our tests like this:

```clj
(deftest foo-does-what-it-should
  (with-recordings some-file
    (is (= (foo user-id) {:something "or other"}))))
```
The data with squirrelled away, at the repl, will now be used to create mocks for `bar` and `baz`.

Whenever the external services that `bar` and `baz` rely on, we can just hit the reple for another `recording` session.
